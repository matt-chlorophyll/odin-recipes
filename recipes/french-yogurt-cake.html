        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a very traditional French cake, probably one of the only cakes French people actually bake.
            I got this from my sister who lived in France for a while. It is great with afternoon tea or even brunch.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 lemons, zested and juiced, divided</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-1/2x4-1/2-inch loaf pan with butter.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine white sugar and lemon zest in a bowl. Rub lemon zest into the sugar with your fingers until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Combine eggs, yogurt, juice of 1 lemon, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixture until blended.
                Add flour mixture and sugar mixture; beat on low speed until batter is just combined. Fold in olive oil gently using a spatula.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
                Let cool in the pan, at least 30 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; invert onto a serving dish.</li>
            <li>Whisk remaining lemon juice and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl to make a thin glaze. Drizzle glaze over cake.</li>
        </ol>
